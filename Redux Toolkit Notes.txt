To install redux tool kit type "npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux"

Step 1 Create a folder in "src" named "store" and create a "slice" named
"cartSlice.js" in it

Slice is a feature of Redux Toolkit which allows us to organise
our store data in small pieces

CHECK CODE IN "cartSlice.js"

Now we configure our store by having "store.js" in "store" folder

CHECK CODE IN "store.js"


IN "App.js" wrap all components inside a "Provider"


INSIDE "App.js"

<Provider store={store}>
        <BrowserRouter>
          <Navbar />
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<Home />}></Route>
            <Route path="/cart" element={<Cart />}></Route>
          </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
</Provider>

NOW CHECK CODE INSIDE "src/components/Product.js" where we want to 
access the initial state of "store/cartSlice.js" and the two methods


THEN CHECK CODE AGAIN IN NAVBAR.JS

IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THE "REDUX STORE" THEN WE HAVE TO DISPATCH THE ACTION

TO UNDERSTAND ASYNCHRONOUS CALLS FROM REDUX STORE WATCH FROM 1 HOUR

CHECK CODE IN "productSlice.js"

WE NEVER DO ASYNCHRONOUS CALLS INSIDE REDUCER AS THET ARE PURE FUNCTION
FOR ASYNCHRONOUS CALLS WE USE "THUNK MIDDLEWARE"

CHECK CODE IN "productSlice.js"

THUNK is a function and inside it we return a new function


TO CREATE THUNK USING REDUX TOOLKIT WATCH FROM 1:01:00 MAYBE
